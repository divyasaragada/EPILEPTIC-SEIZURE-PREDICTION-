The prediction model is built for training EEG data. The proposed algorithm is able to classify the features as normal or seizure . The model is designed as obtaining features from EEG channels. Channel selection is applied to decrease the prediction time and relevant features are extracted after epoch segmentation on the raw EEG data.
The obtained results demonstrated that the X-Trees is the best classifier. About 97% of the accuracy was achieved. 
For the future study, we test the proposed method using other EEG datasets.
